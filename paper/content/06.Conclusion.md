## Conclusion

We present two metal ion location predictors: Metal3D based on 3D convolutional neural networks and Metal1D based on distances. Metal3D is the first tool with sub-angstrom level precision to predict the location of metal ions in proteins that does not rely on searching for structurally homologous proteins in a database. We anticipate different applications such as protein-function annotation using structures predicted using AlphaFold [@doi:10.1038/s41586-021-03828-1], integration in protein design software and detection of cryptic metal binding sites that can be used to engineer PPIs. 
Such cryptic metal ion binding sites in common drug targets could also be used to engineer novel metallodrugs. Many of these applications will allow us to explore the still vastly untapped potential of proteins as large programmable multi-dentate metal ligands with tunable surfaces. 


<!-- Zinc is generally available in the intracellular volume and extracellularly with the total concentration of zinc in cells is estimated to be about about 200 Î¼M [@doi:10.1021/cr800556u]. The real available concentration of free zinc is picomolar[@doi:10.1021/cr800556u] wherefore it is crucial that the design tool produces well designed sites with high spatial precision of the metal ion.  -->
