## Introduction

Metalloproteins protein many biological functions [Percora review]? 
As oneof the most prevalent transition metal cofactors in
biological systems, it plays structural, signaling, and regulatory
roles and is found in all six classes of enzymes (most commonly
hydrolases



Understanding where metals bind in biology is related to health [@doi:10.1038/s42256-019-0119-z], biocatalyis [Kuhlman, Hilvert] and PPIs [Tezcan]. 

Starting with pioneering studies in the 1990 s,[@doi:10.1126/science.8346440;@doi:10.1146/annurev.biochem.68.1.779]there have been notable successes inthe de novo design of functional metalloproteins, which arepredominantly based on four-helix bundle anda-helicalcoiled-coiled motifs with readily parametrizable structure [@doi:10.1002/anie.202009226]. 


Zinc exists as a redox-inert Zn(II) cation with an electron configuration of [Ar]3d10
These properties with the lack of ligand field effects make zinc an excellent metal for different coordination numbers and binding geometries in different biological systems.
 Zinc can be found as an active site metal (cofactor) in all six IUBMB enzyme classes

### Interfaces
It has been hypothesized that some modern metalloproteins may have emerged through the metal-nucleated oligomerization of small peptides or protein domains, followed by the evolution of the resulting assemblies into stable, functional architecture.


Metal-Templated Interface Redesign (MeTIR) ). These strategies, inspired by both the proposed evolutionary roles of metals and their prevalence in natural PPIs, take advantage of the favorable properties of metal coordination (bonding strength, directionality, and reversibility) to guide protein self-assembly with minimal design and engineering

In order to circumvent the complexity of constructing extensive noncovalent interfaces, which are typically involved in natural PPIs

### Existing approaches

Computational predictors of metal-binding sites built on sequence analyses are mostly based on scanning the sequence of a target protein to identify those regions where amino acid patterns match a metal-binding site fingerprint. For zinc binding sites often two histidine spaced by one residue which allows to readily detect the motif are easy to detect. These predictors yield the identites of the coordinating residues. 

Structural detectors often used distance features to identify sites based on statistical mining in the protein databank.  Predictors trained like this can identify highly preorganized motifs (e.g 4x Cys in close spatial proximity) but are often not very good at identifying weakly preorganized motifs. Current state of the art predictors (MIB, BioMetAll) use fragments/homology to predict the location of the metal or backbone preorganization predicting an approximate position of the metal that is less sensitive to the exact side chain geometry thus affording higher sensitivity to detect metal sites(BioMetAll). MIB [@doi:10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00407] uses the fragmentation transformation method to search for homologus sites in its database


In our work we develop two new predictors primarily intended for zinc binding sites - Metal1D and Metal3D that are more accurate and sensitive than existing approaches in predicting metal ion binding sites. We evaluate their capability with respect to
