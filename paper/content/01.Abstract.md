### Abstract

About half of all proteins characterized to date contain a metal. For many of those proteins the metal is important for function. Metals are an attractive cofactor for many applications such as enzyme design or design of protein protein interactions because they are biologically abundant, are bound using strong interactions and have favorable catalytic properties e.g as lewis acid. Computational design of metalloproteins is hampered by the complex electronic structure of many interesting metals such as zinc that cannot be accurately described using a classical forcefield. In this work, we develop two tools -  Metal1D and Metal3D to improve the identification and prediction of metal ion location in proteins. Metal3D is the most accurate metal ion location predictor to date, does not use a database of homologous structures and outputs a confidence metric for each predicted site. The predicted metal ion locations are within 0.7 ± 0.6 Å of the experimental locations. The model predicts a global metal density that can be used for annoation of structures predicted using AlphaFold and a per residue metal density that can be used in protein design workflow to create novel metalloproteins.
