## Abstract

Metal ions are an essential cofactor for many proteins. Currently, about half of the structurally characterized proteins contain a metal ion. Metals are an attractive cofactor for many applications such as enzyme design or design of protein-protein interactions because they are biologically abundant, tether to the protein using strong interactions, and have favorable catalytic properties e.g as lewis acid. Computational design of metalloproteins is hampered by the complex electronic structure of many biologically relevant metals such as zinc that cannot be accurately described using a classical forcefield. In this work, we develop two tools -  Metal1D (based on distances) and Metal3D (based on 3D convolutional neural networks) to improve the identification and localization of metal ions in proteins. Metal3D is the most accurate metal ion location predictor to date, needs just a single structure as input and outputs a confidence metric for each predicted site. Even though the model was trained on zinc it has similar recall for other transition metals. The predicted metal ion locations for Metal3D are within 0.7 ± 0.6 Å of the experimental locations with half of the sites below 0.5 Å. The model predicts a global metal density that can be used for annotation of structures predicted using AlphaFold and a per residue metal density that can be used in protein design workflows for rotamer sampling to create novel metalloproteins.
