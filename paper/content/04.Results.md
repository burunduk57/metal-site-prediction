### Metal1D

<!---
The starting PDB structures used are the ones in the training set, discuss what's the best way to describe it: repeat what is also said later for Metal3D?

The statistical analysis performed is focuses on the LINK records present in deposited PDB structures. LINK data were filtered to obtain a statistically significant sample, restricting only to X-ray structures with resolution better than $2.5 \text{\AA}$, and considering only the best-resolution structure for proteins presenting more than one deposited structure. This filtered sample is used to extract a probability map for the coordinating amino acids, which is used to predict metal sites: for a given protein structure, each amino acid of the protein is scored based on the probability map, performing a geometrical serch around the amino acid. For Zn(II), the average LINK length resulted $(2.2 \pm 0.2)\text{\AA}$, and the default search radius was then set to $5.5\text{\AA}$. 

Once all amino acids in the chain are scored, site predictions are made grouping the highest-scored amino acids in clusters, based on distance. For each cluster, a site prediction is made as a weighted average between the coordinates of the reference point of each amino acid, using as weighting factor the amino acid score. A final re-scoring is performed, now assigning a score to the predicted locations for the sites, based on surrounding amino acids, in order to sort the predictions based on the probability, according to the method. This final re-scoring process also mitigates the possible artefacts originated by the prediction phase, excluding sites  which are placed in positions with a low-probable coordinating  environment.

Not sure if this  two paragraphs are too long for the results section, I tried to highlight how the method works without focusing on the details (explained in the method section), but may need to make it shorter

### Metal3D

The model was trained using a train/test/val split based on sequence identity. We used the MMSeqs2 clustered PDB at 30% sequence identity and used the highest resolution structure from each cluster that contained a zinc, did not contain DNA and had resolution <2.5A. In case no structure was found the cluster was discarded. 

The training examples were sampled from the chosen structure by choosing a balanced number of boxes from each protein that contained or did not contain a zinc. Each box was randomly rotated such that the model is insensitive to rotation. 

Metal3D predicts a per residue score that can then be averaged over all residues or used individually (e.g for protein design). 

Hyperparameter tuning using Ray tune


Evaluation of quality of predictions per box using discretized Jaccard Score (similarity of two sets). We noticed that at the edges often spurious density is predicted .

#### Selectivity for other metals

![Recall for zinc testset and a 25 randomly drawn structures for other transition, alkali and earth-alkali metals for Metal3D](images/metal3d_metal_selectivity.jpg){#fig:selectivity-metal3d}

- Trained exclusively on zinc, predictions are similar for metals with different binding modes e.g Copper
- For sodium (binds via backbone O) not predicted
- Some sites for Mg are predicted with high but not super high probability

Discussion:
Lack in selectivity could be related to smoothing the gaussian quite a bit when training (anything >0.05) is a hit. 

Resolution of grid might be an issue 
Might be improved by improving the grid resolution to 0.5 A

#### Alpha Fold 

AlphaFold often predicts sidechains in metal ion binding sites in the holo conformation. Services like AlphaFill use homology to transplant metals from similar PDB structures to the AlphaFold structure. Metal3D does not use homology can even deal with metal sites that are only partially in the holo conformation.

#### Hidden/transient metalsites

Metallodrugs are in important class of drugs that rely on binding inhibitors to a protein (or DNA). Metal3D can be used to screen the hidden metalloproteome by finding transient metal ion binding sites. 

The site where Rapta binds is detected with p=0.3 but in a high resolution structure without (1KX4) there is a salt bridge with a lysine that might occlude metal detection. One could weight by the rotamer/do MD simulation e.g similar as for cryptic pockets.

#### HCA2: case study

HCA2 is the first enzyme where a catalytic zinc was discovered and is therefore one of the best studied metalloenzymes to date with a rich throve of mutational data available. 
On the wildtype enzyme crystal structure (2CBA) Metal3D perfectly recapitulates the location of the active site metal when using a high probability cutoff (p>0.4). The sites predicted with lower probability all look like reasonable transient binding sites at the surface of the protein.

We used in silico generated mutants matching mutants in the first and second shell of the active site zinc and probed the effect on the predicted metal probability. For mutants that decrease zinc binding also a drop in probability can be observed that correlates well with the experimentally measured $K_d$. We used a consistent set of $K_d$ values from the literature.

### Comparison of Metal1D, Metal3D, MIB and BioMetAll

Many metal ion predictors exists that can be subdivided in two categories: binding site predictors and binding location predictors. The former label only the residues binding the ion, the latter also predict a location of the ion. 

In addition to Metal1D and Metal3D we also compared two recent predictors BioMetAll and MIB. MIB uses a fragment method to identify homologus binding sites to the motifs it finds in a given structure and will extract the location of the metal from the homologous structures in its database. The main performance regulator of MIB is the tscore cutoff which is a parameter for the template similiarity with higher values requiring higher similiarity. 
BioMetAll was calibrated on the PDB and places probes on a regular grid at all sites where they find the criteria to be fulfilled. For each collection of probes also a center of the probes is given which we used to assess performance as there is no individual ranking of the probes given by the program. The main parameter for BioMetAll is the cluster cutoff which indicates how many probes in reference to the largest cluster a specific cluster has. We used a cutoff of 0.5 requiring all chosen clusters to have at least 50% of the probes of the most popolous. 

For both tools the recommended settings match the accuracy of Metal3D p=0.75 with a lot more false positives. 
Metal1D offers high detection capabilites but also with a high number of false positives.
While MIB also offers high precision, BioMetAll (using the cluster center) is not very precise with a MAD for correctly identified sites of 2.8 +- XX. Metal1D which identifies more sites than BioMetAll is slightly more precise than BioMetAll. MIB detects less sites but does so with high precision because it can use homologues sites to correctly place the metal ligand. BioMetAll also often provides probes that correctly identify the metal but as there is no ranking of the probes any probe could be closest to the actual location.
