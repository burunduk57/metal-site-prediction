Metal3D predicts the probability distribution of zinc in protein crystal structures based on a model trained on existing structures. The model is trained similar to image segmentation and is trained on binary output i.e voxel contains metal or not. By limiting the training samples to high resolution crystal structures (2.5 A) we achieve good results with limited noise after grid averaging. The use of high resolution structures is necessary because at resolution greater than the average zinc coordination distance (2.2A) the distance deviations noticeably increases [@doi:10.1021/ic401072d]. 
In contrast to the currently available tools we did not filter the training examples for certain coordination requirements (i.e only sites with at least 3 protein ligands). This allows the model to also predict sites with incomplete coordination or transient sites with only one or two coordination partners that are required to carry out iterative residue sampling in a protein design workflow to start from a non-metal binding protein and equip it with a metal ion binding site. Methods such as MIB which rely on homology therefore perform worse on such weak binding sites because reducing the quality of the available templates by including 1- or 2-coordinate sites would yield many false positives.  Metal3D also explicitly knows about the environment in the vicinity of a putative site and therefore can use the local context to better triage actual metal ion binding sites from other interactions. 
The majority of sites in the training set are well coordinated sites and during training the model can relate the frequency of different metalion binding motifs in the training set with the probability of metal presence. The fraction of artifactutal zinc binding site in the protein data bank is estimated to be about 1/3[@doi:10.1021/ic401072d] with the zinc aiding crystal formation. As we train on biological assemblies some of those binding sites might be located at the surface of the assembly whereas in the assymetric unit of the crystal they might form part of an interface. For the model these half-sites can be seen as data augmentation strategy with noisy incomplete sites. 

Empty coordination sites of metals are filled with water molecules in case there is no other exogenous ligand with higher affinity present (e.g a thiol). Our model does not consider water molecules in the input as the quality of water molecules in the protein databank is not very consistent and in protein design algorithms explicit water molecules are not modeled. Common water placement algorithms to place deep waters are either computationally expensive (MD simulation) or do not consider the location for metal ions (Dowser++ [@doi:10.1002/prot.25081]),  The model inputs for the total density however encode an implicit water function where all empty space can be interpreted as the solvent. 

This work is the first to report a modern deep learning based model destined for metal-protein docking. In the more general space of protein-ligand docking a variety of architectures and representations have been used. 3D CNN based approaches such as LigVoxel and DeepSite commonly use a resolution of XX A and similar input features as our model to predict the ligand density. However, predicting the density of a multi-nuclear ligand is more complex as predicting the location of mononuclear metal ions. We therefore did not deem it necessary to include a conditioning on how many metal ions are present in the box and rather chose to reflect this in the training data where the model needs to learn that only about half of the environments it sees contain a metal. Using mesh convolutional neural networks on a protein surface representation also has been used to predict the location and identity of protein ligands but can only label the regions of the surface that bind the metal ion and do not give the exact location of the metal. The most recent approaches such as EquiDock use equivariant neural networks such as En-Transformer (Sarattras) to predict binding keypoints (defined as 1/2 distance between the CA of the binding residue and a ligand atom). Explicit sidechains are still to expensive for such models. In addition the current state of the art architecture achieves a mean RMSD for the ligand of <2A only for 25% of their testset. Our model in contrast has a a mean RMSD of <1A which remains almost constant no matter the chosen probability cutoff. The lack of accuracy of the equivariant approaches renders them unsuitable for design of complex metal ion binding sites supported by an intricate network of hydrogen bonds that need to be position with sub-angstrom accuracy. Our model in contrast is computationally more expensive due to the need to voxelize the input. 
Protein design using 3D convolutional neural nets trained on residue identity has been successfully demonstrated and we anticipate that our model could be seamlessly integrated into such as workflow (Anand Nature Comms) to enable fully deep learning based design of metalloproteins. 

In terms of selectivity our model has a clear preference for transition metals over main group metals. The only sites identified for sodium in the test set are the ones that have sidechain ligands. Many sodium and potassium sites are using backbone carbonyl coordination exclusively which is not common for zinc and those sites are therefore not detected. It has recently been demonstrated how a transition metal can be selectively bound to a protein (Choi, Tezcan, Nature 2022). This however was only achieved using non-ideal coordination which is better tolerated by some transition metals due to the different electronic configurations. Zinc is much more inflexible than e.g copper in this regard which exhibits Jahn-Teller distortions and thus can accomodate the more diverse ligand coordination environments. It is likely impossible to train a predictor that can perfectly discriminate zinc from e.g copper and nickel sites because the coordination environments and coordination distances are so similar. The availability of metals inside the organism is compartimentalized, therefore an approach using solely the structure will be unable to capture the full selectivity. In addition sometimes non-native metals are used for crystallization experiments because the reaction catalyzed by an active site metal might exhibit different kinetics with different metals. 

Metal3D is the first tool with angstrom level precision to predict the location of metal ion binding sites suitable for optimization of proteins. Different applications are possible: Protein-Function annotation using structures predicted using Alpha Fold, Engineering of novel metalloproteins as biosensors or de novo enzymes, design of metal mediated PPIs or for design of metallodrugs that crosslink multiple faint metalbinding sites on the protein. Many of these applications allow to explore the still vastly untapped potential of proteins as large  programmable multidentate metal ligands. In particular it might be easier to design protein binders using metal mediated interactions as the metal binding can overcome the entropic cost of association of two protein surfaces. Zinc is generally available in the intracellular volume and extracellurly with the total concentration of zinc in cells estimated at about 200 μM. The real available concentration of free zinc is picomolar[@doi:10.1021/cr800556u].

Our tool allows to move away from using rational approaches such as the  i, i + 4 diHis motifs used for the assembly and stabilization of metalloproteins and peptides through coordination of divalent transition metal ions to a more knowledgebased approach.

Choice of resolution cutoff
Zinc The average bond length corresponds to a resolution of ∼2.2 Å. Also, the deviation increases noticeably after the resolution exceeds 2.5 Å. [@doi:10.1021/ic401072d]

Why were nucleic structures excluded? Why include all zinc sites and not just the good ones?


model choice? Why are CNNs better than equivariant approaches for this kind of work?. Recent work EquiDock uses no sidechains at all, gets ligand RMSD where only 25% are under a 2 threshold, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.05146.pdf Mean RMSD 8.3 A, Centroid 42.4


MIB discards all sites with less than 2 coordination partners so it will not be able to identify labile binding sites. 

Discuss 4L99 which is one of the FN for the model. Here are Lysine next to the zinc and therefore probability is low.Could be wrongly modeled (carboxlyated lysine instead of normal lysine) [@doi:10.1016/S0022-2836(02)00422-9] but some leucyl aminopeptidases also have this coordination. (check 10.1515/BC.2006.191 to find mechanism)


discuss why water molecules were not considered. considered only implicitly. Might be integrated in future but needs quality check for existing waters in training/test set 
Methods [References Dowser] that place deep waters but they do not know about metals. 


Lack in selectivity could be related to smoothing the gaussian quite a bit when training (anything >0.05) is a hit. 
Resolution of grid might be an issue 
Might be improved by improving the grid resolution to 0.5  

Discuss selectivity. E.g based on [@doi:10.1073/pnas.0906852107]. Zinc prefers tetrahedral coordination, whereas e.g copper(II) (and maybe CU(I)- check it) prefers square planar which might explain a bit lower selctivity. In the work by Tezcan the protein assemblies form different complexes with the different metals. 

General implications for the faint metal ion binding sites detected using the model: This is evident from the fact that unstructured polypeptides and folded proteins alike often form aggregates in the presence of high concentrations of transition metals.
Once the entropic cost of association is overcome, the resulting noncovalent interfaces can be optimized through additional mutations
 These nonspecific interactions could explain why free zinc concentration is tightly controlled in cellular environments; the total concentration of zinc in cells is about 200 μM, but the concentration of free zinc is only picomolar[@doi:10.1021/cr800556u].

From a practical inorganic chemical viewpoint individual proteins can be utilized as large polydentate ligands that bring along the advantage of having extensive functionalizable surfaces. From a functional perspective metals possess properties such as Lewis acidity and redox reactivity that enable them to carry out catalytic transformations not accessible by organic building blocks.

Our tool allows to move away from using rational approaches such as the  i, i + 4 diHis motifs used for the assembly and stabilization of metalloproteins and peptides through coordination of divalent transition metal ions to a more knowledgebased approach. [@doi:10.1126/science.8346440; @doi:10.1126/science.1648261; @doi:10.1038/nsb723]


Moreover, one-third of the zinc ions present in crystal structures are artifacts, merely aiding crystal formation and packing with no biological significance [@doi:10.1021/ic401072d]

 The small size of the Zn(II) cation (∼74 pm for four-coordinate and ∼88 pm for six-coordinate ion) prevents higher coordination numbers due to molecular repulsion and higher energy orbitals

Discussion with DeepSite which uses a sliding box approach and does not give individual residue scores. Therefore less useful for protein design. -->
