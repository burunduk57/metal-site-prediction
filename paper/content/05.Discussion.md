3D CNN model accuracy. Recent work EquiDock uses no sidechains at all, gets ligand RMSD where only 25% are under a 2 threshold, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.05146.pdf Mean RMSD 8.3 A, Centroid 42.4


MIB discards all sites with less than 2 coordination partners so it will not be able to identify labile binding sites. 

Discuss 4L99 which is one of the FN for the model. Here are Lysine next to the zinc and therefore probability is low.Could be wrongly modeled (carboxlyated lysine instead of normal lysine) [@doi:10.1016/S0022-2836(02)00422-9] but some leucyl aminopeptidases also have this coordination. (check 10.1515/BC.2006.191 to find mechanism)


discuss why water molecules were not considered. considered only implicitly. Might be integrated in future but needs quality check for existing waters in training/test set 
Methods [References Dowser] that place deep waters but they do not know about metals. 


Lack in selectivity could be related to smoothing the gaussian quite a bit when training (anything >0.05) is a hit. 
Resolution of grid might be an issue 
Might be improved by improving the grid resolution to 0.5  

Discuss selectivity. E.g based on [@doi:10.1073/pnas.0906852107]. Zinc prefers tetrahedral coordination, whereas e.g copper(II) (and maybe CU(I)- check it) prefers square planar which might explain a bit lower selctivity. In the work by Tezcan the protein assemblies form different complexes with the different metals. 

General implications for the faint metal ion binding sites detected using the model: This is evident from the fact that unstructured polypeptides and folded proteins alike often form aggregates in the presence of high concentrations of transition metals.
Once the entropic cost of association is overcome, the resulting noncovalent interfaces can be optimized through additional mutations
 These nonspecific interactions could explain why free zinc concentration is tightly controlled in cellular environments; the total concentration of zinc in cells is about 200 μM, but the concentration of free zinc is only picomolar[@doi:10.1021/cr800556u].

From a practical inorganic chemical viewpoint individual proteins can be utilized as large polydentate ligands that bring along the advantage of having extensive functionalizable surfaces. From a functional perspective metals possess properties such as Lewis acidity and redox reactivity that enable them to carry out catalytic transformations not accessible by organic building blocks.

Our tool allows to move away from using rational approaches such as the  i, i + 4 diHis motifs used for the assembly and stabilization of metalloproteins and peptides through coordination of divalent transition metal ions to a more knowledgebased approach.

Moreover, one-third of the zinc ions present in crystal structures are artifacts, merely aiding crystal formation and packing with no biological significance [@doi:10.1021/ic401072d]

 The small size of the Zn(II) cation (∼74 pm for four-coordinate and ∼88 pm for six-coordinate ion) prevents higher coordination numbers due to molecular repulsion and higher energy orbitals


 <!-- KD values discussion (new ITC data vs. old data by Kiefer, Fierke etc): 
 
 Old method: Enzyme-
bound zinc (E—Zn) was quantitated using the colorimetric
4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol (PAR) method of Hunt et al.
(1984) and measuring the absorbance at 500 nm. 4-(2-Pyridylazo)resorcinol (PAR) is a dibasic acid that forms the protonated complexes with most metal ions. It serves as a metallochromic indicator and is suitable as a chromogenic agent for the quantitative determination of over 50 elements.

removing unbound zinc by chromatography on a
PD-10 column, and measuring the protein concentration and
bound zinc concentration in the eluant using the PAR assay
(Hunt et al., 1984).
The concentration of free zinc in the
dialysis buffer was calculated from the Tris—zinc stability
constants (Dawson et al., 1986). The dissociation constant
was calculated using KaleidaGraph program with eq:
[E-ZN]/[E]tot = C/(1+Kd/[Zn]free)
