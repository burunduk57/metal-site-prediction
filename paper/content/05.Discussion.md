## Discussion

3D CNN model accuracy. Recent work EquiDock uses no sidechains at all, gets ligand RMSD where only 25% are under a 2 threshold, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.05146.pdf Mean RMSD 8.3 A, Centroid 42.4


MIB discards all sites with less than 2 coordination partners so it will not be able to identify labile binding sites. 

Discuss 4L99 which is one of the FN for the model. Here are Lysine next to the zinc and therefore probability is low.


discuss why water molecules were not considered. considered only implicitly. Might be integrated in future but needs quality check for existing waters in training/test set 
Methods [References Dowser] that place deep waters but they do not know about metals.
