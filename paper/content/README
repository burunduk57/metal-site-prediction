Predicting location of transition metals in protein structures using 3DCNNs 



Content: In this paper we describe a framework to predict a probability density map of the location
of transition metals (e.g Zn) in protein structures using 3DCNNs. The network predicts a score per
residue and our tool Metal3D allows to average those predictions to obtain a map of metal density
across a protein structure. 
The tool can be easily integrated into protein design software, can be used to add missing metal
ligands to predicted structures using AlphaFold without relying on homology or to find hidden
metallosites relevant to develop PPIs or metallodrugs.
